## Project: Sales Data Analysis & Visualization

This project demonstrates time-series analysis and visualization of sales data using Python. The main script (`newproject.py`) loads sales data, resamples it to weekly totals, and visualizes trends using line plots and rolling averages. It also detects anomalies in sales using z-score statistics and highlights them on the plots. Additionally, the code summarizes sales by year and quarter, providing insights into seasonal and annual performance.

### Key Features
- Loads and processes time-series sales data from CSV
- Weekly sales trend visualization
- Rolling average for smoothing trends
- Anomaly detection using z-score
- Yearly and quarterly sales summaries

This project is useful for understanding sales patterns, identifying unusual spikes or drops, and gaining insights into business performance over time.

## Features
- Collection of Python scripts and data files
- Easy navigation and organization
- Useful for learning, experimentation, and sharing code

## Getting Started
Clone or download the repository to explore the included projects. Each script is self-contained and can be run independently.

## Structure
- Python scripts for different tasks
- Data files for analysis and practice
- README for documentation

Feel free to contribute or use the code for your own learning and development!ok
## Usage
